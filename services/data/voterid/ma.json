    "• You are an inactive voter",
    "• You are casting a provisional or challenged ballot",
    "• The poll worker has a reasonable suspicion that leads them to request identification",
    "If you are unable to present identification when you check-in, you may cast a provisional ballot and return later with identification. If you do not return with acceptable identification by close of polls, your ballot cannot be counted. If you an inactive voter or a poll worker requests identification and you are not able to present it, you must still be permitted to vote; however, your ballot must be challenged. This means that your name and address, the name and address of the challenger, and the reason for the challenge must be written on your ballot. You ballot will be cast normally and will only be re-examined in the case of a recount, court order, or audit."
