  "notes": [
    "Your ID does not need to show your address. If you do not have photo ID, you can still cast a ballot by signing an affidavit. The affidavit can be used by voters who do not have acceptable photo ID or voters who have photo ID but didn't bring it to the polls. Once you sign the affidavit, you may cast your ballot. It will be counted with all other ballots on Election Day. If you do not have a driver's license or other acceptable photo identification, you can get a state identification card at your local Secretary of State branch office for $10. State ID cards are free to individuals who are 65 or older or who are blind. Cards are also free to those who have had driving privileges terminated due to a physical or mental disability. The fee can also be waived for individuals who present other good cause for a fee waiver."
