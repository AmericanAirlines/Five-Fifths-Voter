    "Voters do not need to provide a copy of their ID in order to cast a vote by mail ballot except under certain circumstances for first time voters. These voters will receive a notice with their vote by mail ballot. While the November 3, 2020 election is being conducted primarily with vote by mail ballots, with each active registered New Jersey voter receiving a vote by mail ballot, there will still be at least one polling location available in every municipality in the state and each county will operate at least 50% of its normal polling location capacity. Voters who do not receive a vote by mail ballot or who prefer to vote in person will cast a paper ballot at their designated polling location. Voters with disabilities that prevent them from voting by paper ballot will have access to a voting assistance device. "
