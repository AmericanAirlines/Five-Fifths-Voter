    "Do I need a voting card or my ID in order to vote? No, the card is for information only and does not need to be presented to election officials in order to vote. The only time voters are asked for their ID (or a form of address verification) is if they were a first time Nebraska registrant who mailed in their registration application and didnâ€™t provide ID or a form of address verification (copy of a utility bill, bank statement, government check, paycheck, or other government document that is current and shows your name and residence address) at that time."
