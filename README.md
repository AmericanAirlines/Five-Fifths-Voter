# Problem and solution

Black voters have experienced obstacles in casting their votes for a long while. The process of casting a vote is challenging due to restrcitive local processes, changing requirements, regulations, and lack of information.

The solution offered by the **Five Fifths Voter** solutioon will help ensure that Black voters can identify the correct polling station, quickly and affordably, according to their own schedule. The project also equips voters with the necessary information to vote according up to date and local requirements.

# Pitch

The **Five Fifths Voter** application is designed to create a fair and equal opportunity voting process for marginalized voters by providing knowledge and accessibility to required voting elements. **Five Fifths Voter** will leverage technology to help voters identify and aim to eliminate bias and prejudice that is embedded in the voting system.

# Skills

All developers can assist with this solution. Currently, it is built with `Vue.js` for the UI and `Node/Express` for the API layer.
