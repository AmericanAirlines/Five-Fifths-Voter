# Problem & Solution
Black Voters have for years experienced roadblocks. The process may be impossible or challenging due to burdensome local processes, changing requirements, regulations, and lack of information.

Our solution will ensure that Black voters are able to get to the correct polling station, quickly and affordably according to their own schedule and are able to equip themselves with the necessary information to vote according to the most up to date, and local requirements.

# Pitch
The embRACEtheVOTE app creates a truly fair and equal opportunity voting process by providing knowledge and accessibility to all required elements. embRACEtheVOTE will leverage our technology to both identify and strive to eliminate bias/prejudice embedded in the voting system.

# Skills
All developers can assist with this solution. Currently it is built with Vue JS for the UI and Node/Express for the API layer.
