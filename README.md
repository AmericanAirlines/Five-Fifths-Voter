# The Problem
Black voters in Georgia (and elsewhere) need get to the correct polling station, quickly and affordably according to their own schedule and are able to equip themselves with the necessary information and to vote according to the most up​ to date, local requirements.​

Let's use web technology on the IBM cloud to help!

# Solution
A virtual ONE-STOP-SHOP  for Black voters to assist  them with all their voting  needs. Our mission statement is described in the 3 E’s:
- EDUCATE 
- EMPOWER
- ENABLE

# Skills
All developers can assist with this solution. Currently it is built with Vue JS for the UI and Node/Express for the API layer.

# Reference and Data
