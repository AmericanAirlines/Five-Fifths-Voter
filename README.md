# What is the problem?

For centuries, voters in disparate communities, particularly Black voters, have experienced obstacles in casting their votes be it situational or intentionally constructed. Voting has been perceived an intangible and unfair process based on restrictive local processes, changing requirements, regulations, inability to access the correct voting location, and lack of information. As a result millions of minority votes go uncounted, purged, or simply not submitted do to lack of faith and trust in the system.

The **Five Fifths Voter** solution starter will provide a capability to help ensure disenfranchised minority voters are Educated, Empowered, and Enabled to overcome setbacks incurred by voter suppresion through achieving the following; clearly identifying the correct polling station, notifying users of all requirements needed for their state and personal circumstances as it pertains to different types of voting, deadlines, and quick access. This solution helps to rewrite the narrative by placing control back in the voters' hands,  generating a voter journey that prioritizes their individual lifestyle and needs.

Furthermore, **Five Fifths Voter** strives to evolve the culture of voting and enable users to build a relationship with us through having the ability to select personalized features that enhance their experience and interact with other users to become a part of a community.

# Pitch

The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was enacted to prohibit racial discrimination in voting. Yet, history has shown the inequalities such as voter suppression have led to corruption and a weak democracy that does not reflect the will of the people.

The IBM Call for Code for Policy & Legislation Reform has developed a solution to support the voter experience that focuses on addressing key areas of voter suppression such as voter registration, voter ID laws, voter registration restrictions, voter purging, felony disenfranchisement, and gerrymandering, all of which are contributors to disenfranchising minorities and people with disabilities.

**Five Fifths Voter** is a cognitive solution designed to determine optimal voting strategies for each individual voter while limiting the impact of previous suppression issues.
