# Problem and solution

Black voters have experienced obstacles in casting their votes for long. The process of casting a vote is challenging due to restrcitive local processes, changing requirements, regulations, and lack of information.

The solution offered by the **five/fifth voter** application will ensure that Black voters reach the correct polling station, quickly and affordably, according to their own schedule. The project also equips the voters with the necessary information to vote according to the most up to date and local requirements.

# Pitch

The **five/fifths voter** application creates a fair and equal opportunity voting process by providing knowledge and accessibility to the required elements. **five/fifths voter** will leverage our technology to identify and eliminate bias and prejudice that is embedded in the voting system.

# Skills

All developers can assist with this solution. Currently, it is built with `Vue.js` for the UI and `Node/Express` for the API layer.
